- Basics of Python programming.
- Introduction to AutoGen and LLM.
- Create a basic chatbot script.

#### Day 2:
- Enhance the chatbot with planning and execution phases.
- Understand how the chatbot makes decisions.

#### Day 3:
- Introduce a feedback loop to enhance the learning capability of the chatbot.
- Learn how feedback improves chatbot responses.

#### Day 4:
- Dive into iterative development.
- Improve the chatbot with multiple iterations.

#### Day 5:

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txtRunning the ChatbotNavigate to the directory containing the chatbot script and run:python chatbot.pyFollow the on-screen prompts to interact with the chatbot.ContributingWe welcome contributions! Feel free to open pull requests to improve the chatbot and the guide.LicenseThis project is open source, under the MIT license.### Note:
- Replace `"python chatbot.py"` with the actual command needed to run your specific chatbot script.
- You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing all the Python libraries that need to be installed to run the chatbot.

Customize this README file as per your project's specific needs, and it should provide a good starting point to help others understand and use your project effectively.
